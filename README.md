Please see the [the wiki](https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SELV/Data+Edit+Tool+Configuration+and+Notes) for details about using the Data Edit tool. The driver mentioned there may be downloaded from the [PostgreSQL site](http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/).

This repository includes two versions of the Data Edit Tool - one in the Benin folder and the other in the SELV directory. Although a cursory look at the two suggests they're equivalent, there exist binary differences between them. Possibly, these are a result of potential schema differences between SELV and Benin.
